# staffchat
- Minecraft StaffChat Using [Paper](https://papermc.io/software/paper/) and [ACF](https://github.com/aikar/commands/) 
- For some odd reason it doesn't seem to work with certain Plugins when I was testing it


/sc - toggles staff chat on/off
/sc <message> - Sends a message in staff chat


### Start message with "@":
- if staff chat on:
    - sends message in Global chat and removes @
- if staff chat off:
    - sends message in staff chat and removes @
